## just beginning to think about it ... 
`--same`
`--color` --> for the msmeo usage this is what it uses for some operatinos....
`--subject` `subject-gql {descriptor}` --> send to a gan type thing
### it strikes me the parses will need several pre sorts.. which might be good enough
`--pre infinite` default
### the result is a guesssed percentage
`--result`
